# 🛠️ 8 Express.js Projects Every Beginner Should Build

I built 8 small Express.js projects to practice routing, middleware, error handling, and basic REST API design. Each project solves a specific problem and helped me get hands-on with backend development.

### ✅ What’s Included

1. **Student Management API** – Full CRUD for student records  
2. **Static Pages** – `/about`, `/contact`, `/services` with custom text  
3. **Route Logger** – Middleware that logs every request method and URL  
4. **Error Handling** – Simulated crash and custom 404 + 500 pages  
5. **Feedback Collector** – `POST /feedback` with validation and custom response  
6. **Course Details API** – `GET /courses/:id` returns course info from mock data  
7. **Simple Blog Viewer** – List blog titles and full post by ID  
8. **Search & Filters** – Filter students by course using query params

Each file is simple, readable, and can be run directly using Node.js + Express.

### 📮 Use Postman to Test the APIs

### 🧪 Run It
```bash
# Initialize your project
npm init -y

# Install Express.js
npm install express

# Run a specific project file
node project_1.js   # Replace 1 with the project number (1 to 8)
